# The Awesome

The [Python 3 Porting Fedora Activity Day](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/help-port-python-packages-to-python-3/) wrapped up this Sunday. In the span of ~48 hours and three continents, we've done [a lot of things](https://github.com/fedora-python/portingdb/compare/cbea35d4b607779d2f9b75932cf6b389e87ea0c9...8f7d4254db04748d05e57fc9f1808902101c716f):

32 people had made 126 commits to the portingdb, with 3,803 additions and 3,226 deletions, making the [portingdb](http://portingdb-encukou.rhcloud.com/) more useful for everyone.

We've filled numerous bugs for Fedora packages that lack Python 3 support, providing an updated .spec file for 9 of them.

Best of all, 7 upstreams received Python 3 compatibility patches!

This all with the help of people from around the world, from all sorts of distros, cooperating on-line and off.

I'd like to thank **frafra**, **michel-slm**, **fujimotos**, **michaeleekk**, **rodrigc**, **barracks510**, **fitoria**, **rupe120**, **decause**, **sayanchowdhury**, **Richard Sarkis**, **Sebastian Dyroff**, **Fale**, **dperson**, **fabaff**, **Riamse**, **carlwgeorge**, **MSK61**, **jflory7**, **mayorgatellez**, **staranjeet**, **QuLogic**, **hroncok**, **booxter**, **tyll**, **pigjuliux**, **williamjmorenor** for making this awesome, and **abadger**, **threebean** and **encukou** for handling all the awesomeness. :)

# What's next?

One thing is for sure, this isn't the last Python 3 Porting day! It's been a lot of fun and we've learned a lot, so we would like to have another P3P Day in a month or two. Be sure to tweet at me, or join the #fedora-python channel on Freenode, if you have any suggestion on how to make it even better than it was. :)
